## JavaScript Constructor Method
A constructor in JavaScript is a special function used to create and initialize objects. 
It sets up object properties and is typically invoked using the new keyword. 
Constructors allow for the creation of multiple instances with similar properties and methods.

** In JavaScript, constructors can be defined in two main ways

Function Constructor (Before ES6)
Class Constructor (ES6 and Beyond)

1. Function Constructor Method (Before ES6)
Before ES6, JavaScript used constructor functions to create and initialize objects. 
A constructor function is essentially a regular function that is invoked using the new keyword. 
Here's how you define a constructor function.
e.g.
function Car(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.getCarInfo = function () {
        return `${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`;
    };
}

let myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020);
console.log(myCar.getCarInfo());

output:-
2020 Toyota Camry
The Car function is a constructor function.
Inside the constructor function, the this keyword refers to the new instance of the object being created.
It assigns values to the make, model, and year properties.
The getCarInfo method is also attached to the new object, which returns a string with the car's details.

2. Class Constructor Method (ES6 and Beyond)
With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript introduced class syntax, making object-oriented programming more structured and readable.
Classes provide a more modern and organized way to define constructors.
class Car {
    constructor(make, model, year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    getCarInfo() {
        return `${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`;
    }
}

let myCar = new Car('Honda', 'Civic', 2022);
console.log(myCar.getCarInfo());

output:-
2022 Honda Civic
The Car class contains a special method called constructor().
This method is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created using the new keyword.
The constructor() method initializes the properties (make, model, year) for the new object.
Methods like getCarInfo can be defined directly inside the class.

## How constructor works in JavaScript?
A constructor is a special function used to create and initialize objects, defined using the function keyword or class syntax.
The new keyword triggers the constructor, creating a new object and setting this to refer to it.
Inside the constructor, properties are assigned to the object using this, and can be set dynamically via constructor arguments.
The constructor implicitly returns the newly created object, allowing access to its properties and methods.

## new keyword in JavaScript
The new keyword in JavaScript is used to create an object out of a constructor function in a class representation and also from the normal function's.
